<div id="intro-whatis"><h3>What is the Social Justice Platform Data Catalog?</h3></div>

<p>The Social Justice Platform (SJP) Data Catalog is an open source collection of data sets, resources, and tools with a 
specific emphasis on social justice. The goal of this catalog is to provide a focused repository of social justice and 
equity resources where researchers and analysts can go to explore relevant data for their projects. Users can interactively 
search through the catalog using the SJP Data Catalog Dashboard. The dashboard includes features such as keyword-driven 
searching, filtering by various characteristics and topics (e.g. tags, year, geographic level), as well as the ability to 
save and export metadata for desired sources. Note that this catalog is intended to serve as a tool for exploring publicly 
available data resources in the social justice realm, not as a database for housing these resources. The catalog provides 
multiple levels of metadata on each resource and includes links to access the data from its native source.</p>

<div id="intro-benefits"><h3>Benefits of this catalog</h3></div>

<p>Though there exists other databases and repositories for social justice data, many of them are narrowly scoped or 
are tailored towards a specific tool or resource. We seek to add to these existing repositories by serving as a comprehensive 
collection of data sources spanning a variety of social justice domains. This catalog distinguishes itself from others by 
using metadata to draw connections between sources. Using these connections, the dashboard can provide users with a set of 
resource recommendationsâ€”allowing users to further explore the resources in their domain of interest.</p>
