<p>The <i>Insights</i> tab provides tools and visualizations for exploring the catalog contents from an overarching conceptual lens. You can choose to explore these analyses for the entire data catalog or for the set of resources currently in the <i>Saved Resources</i> tab by toggling the "View Catalog" and "View Saved Resources" buttons. The following plots and visuals will help visualize the types of features and themes present among the specified set of resources. Though the specific interpretations of these figures will vary depending on the set of resources you are considering, below is an explanation of the contents in each tab and how the resulting figures might be interpreted:</p>
        
<ul>
  <li><b>Features</b>: The <i>Features</i> tab contains distributions of data types and years available. These distributions will
  help you visualize what the spread of resource types and years are across the chosen set of resources. For example, they may 
  reveal that certain resource types are more prevalent than others in your resource set or that majority of the data is available 
  for a specific time period.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Tags</b>: The <i>Tags</i> tab contains a wordcloud depicting the distribution of tags gathered from the chosen set of 
  resources. The size of a word is proportional to the number of resources in the set that has that tag. It is visually useful
  to examine the general breadth or scope of domains and features present in the resource set as well as which of those features
  are more heavily represented. Hovering over individual words will reveal an exact count of the number of resources utilizing
  that specific tag.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Domain Connections</b>: The <i>Domain Connections</i> tab contains an interactive network diagram which shows
  the different flows or connections between various resource attributes. This is useful for investigating how certain features
  and domains are related to each other; that is, what types of domains are nested within the broader resource types and what 
  types of features are available within those domains. For example, examining the flows from the "Health" node to the various
  stratification nodes might reveal that there are already many resources within the health domain that are race/ethnicity 
  and gender stratified but there are none that are disability stratified. This type of analysis has the potential to not only
  highlight what features of the data are represented, but also reveal where there might be existing gaps among the available 
  resources, providing opportunities for novel contributions.</li>
</ul>
             
<p>You can also use the checkbox filters in the sidebar to explore more specific subsets of resources according to various data types
and domains.</p>
