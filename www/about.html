<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is the Social Justice Platform Data Catalog?</h3>

<p>The Social Justice Platform (SJP) Data Catalog is an open source collection of data sets, resources, and tools with a 
specific emphasis on social justice. The goal of this catalog is to provide a focused repository of social justice and 
equity resources where researchers and analysts can go to explore relevant data for their projects. Users can interactively 
search through the catalog using the SJP Data Catalog Dashboard. The dashboard includes features such as keyword-driven 
searching, filtering by various characteristics and topics (e.g. tags, year, geographic level), as well as the ability to 
save and export metadata for desired sources. Note that this catalog is intended to serve as a tool for exploring publicly 
available data resources in the social justice realm, not as a database for housing these resources. The catalog provides 
multiple levels of metadata on each resource and includes links to access the data from its native source.</p>

<h3>Benefits of this catalog</h3> 

<p>Though there exists other databases and repositories for social justice data, many of them are narrowly scoped or 
are tailored towards a specific tool or resource. We seek to add to these existing repositories by serving as a comprehensive 
collection of data sources spanning a variety of social justice domains. This catalog distinguishes itself from others by 
using metadata to draw connections between sources. Using these connections, the dashboard can provide users with a set of 
resource recommendations—allowing users to further explore the resources in their domain of interest.</p>

<h2>Catalog Contents</h2>

<p>The SJP Data Catalog contains a total of 98 resources--53 datatsets, 13 data repositories, 19 interactive tools, 
6 summary tables, and 7 data methodologies. The resources represented in the catalog are diverse across multiple 
characteristics with data availability spanning from 1946 to present day and geographic levels as broad as national level 
and as narrow as zip codes. A total of 66 distinct tags are used to describe the available resources and cover features 
ranging from topic/subject to data collection method to stratifications. For a more detailed summary of the catalog and 
its contents, please visit the <i>Insights</i> tab.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Catalog</h2>

<h3>Search the catalog</h3>

<p>Users can explore the full catalog of data in the “Search Catalog” tab of the dashboard. This page includes several 
convenient ways to search and filter for resources within the catalog.</p>

<p>Users can search by entering keywords into the search bar. This is a free-text field where users can enter any keywords 
or phrases. After entering text, the dashboard will return any resources that have any descriptions or characteristics 
which match the phrases entered into the search bar.</p>

<p>Another way to search the catalog is through various filters. Users can filter through resources by tags, years, 
and geographic levels available. The different types of filter categories can be used in conjunction with each other, 
granting the ability to perform highly customizable searches.</p>

<h3>Viewing the catalog</h3>

<p>There are multiple options for viewing the selected resources in order to help users organize their search results. 
Resources being shown in the main panel of the dashboard can be sorted according to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alphabetical by Name</li>
  <li>Year: Oldest to Newest</li>
  <li>Year: Newest to Oldest</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can also control the number of resources to show per page and can navigate through the pages to see more resources.</p>

<h3>Resource recommendations</h3>

<p>Another key feature of the catalog is its ability to recommend similar resources to the user based on the results from 
their search criteria. Each of the individual resource entries have a toggle at the bottom of its card which, when switched 
on, will reveal (if any) recommended sources which share similar features to the original resource. A brief description of 
each recommendation is provided as well as lists of shared features between the two resources. Furthermore, below these 
descriptions are two buttons which allow users to view full details of the recommended resource or save the recommendation 
directly to their “Saved Resources” page.</p>

<h3>Saving resources</h3>

<p>As users navigate through the dashboard and explore relevant data sources, they can “save” resources to a shopping 
cart-like page at multiple points throughout their perusal. This feature allows users to keep track of any relevant, useful, 
and interesting data sources. “Save” buttons are denoted with a heart-shaped icon. Clicking any of the “Save” buttons will 
add the resource to the “Saved Resources” tab at the top of the page. Within the “Saved Resources” tab, users can view a list 
of all their saved resources. By default, each resource will be shown as a single row with some basic summary information shown 
as well as a set of action buttons. The “Expand” button will open a card similar to the ones shown on the main page of the 
“Search Catalog” tab containing more detailed information about the resource. The trash button will remove the individual 
resource from the “Saved Resources” page.</p>

<p>Once users are satisfied with their collection of saved resources, they can use the “Export to…” feature to export their 
curated data repository as either a CSV file or a PDF report. Alternatively, if the user would like to clear their cart and 
start over, this can be accomplished by clicking the “Remove All” button in the top right-hand corner of the page."</p>
