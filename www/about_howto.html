<h2>How to Use the Catalog</h2>

<h3>Search the catalog</h3>

<p>Users can explore the full catalog of data in the “Search Catalog” tab of the dashboard. This page includes several 
convenient ways to search and filter for resources within the catalog.</p>

<p>Users can search by entering keywords into the search bar. This is a free-text field where users can enter any keywords 
or phrases. After entering text, the dashboard will return any resources that have any descriptions or characteristics 
which match the phrases entered into the search bar.</p>

<p>Another way to search the catalog is through various filters. Users can filter through resources by tags, years, 
and geographic levels available. The different types of filter categories can be used in conjunction with each other, 
granting the ability to perform highly customizable searches.</p>

<h3>Viewing the catalog</h3>

<p>There are multiple options for viewing the selected resources in order to help users organize their search results. 
Resources being shown in the main panel of the dashboard can be sorted according to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alphabetical by Name</li>
  <li>Year: Oldest to Newest</li>
  <li>Year: Newest to Oldest</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can also control the number of resources to show per page and can navigate through the pages to see more resources.</p>

<h3>Resource recommendations</h3>

<p>Another key feature of the catalog is its ability to recommend similar resources to the user based on the results from 
their search criteria. Each of the individual resource entries have a toggle at the bottom of its card which, when switched 
on, will reveal (if any) recommended sources which share similar features to the original resource. A brief description of 
each recommendation is provided as well as lists of shared features between the two resources. Furthermore, below these 
descriptions are two buttons which allow users to view full details of the recommended resource or save the recommendation 
directly to their “Saved Resources” page.</p>

<h3>Saving resources</h3>

<p>As users navigate through the dashboard and explore relevant data sources, they can “save” resources to a shopping 
cart-like page at multiple points throughout their perusal. This feature allows users to keep track of any relevant, useful, 
and interesting data sources. “Save” buttons are denoted with a heart-shaped icon. Clicking any of the “Save” buttons will 
add the resource to the “Saved Resources” tab at the top of the page. Within the “Saved Resources” tab, users can view a list 
of all their saved resources. By default, each resource will be shown as a single row with some basic summary information shown 
as well as a set of action buttons. The “Expand” button will open a card similar to the ones shown on the main page of the 
“Search Catalog” tab containing more detailed information about the resource. The trash button will remove the individual 
resource from the “Saved Resources” page.</p>

<p>Once users are satisfied with their collection of saved resources, they can use the “Export to…” feature to export their 
curated data repository as either a CSV file or a PDF report. Alternatively, if the user would like to clear their cart and 
start over, this can be accomplished by clicking the “Remove All” button in the top right-hand corner of the page."</p>
