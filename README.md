# Social Justice Platform Data Catalog

The Social Justice Platform (SJP) Data Catalog is an open source collection of data sets, resources, and tools with a 
specific emphasis on social justice. The goal of this catalog is to provide a focused repository of social justice and 
equity resources where researchers and analysts can go to explore relevant data for their projects. Users can interactively 
search through the catalog using the SJP Data Catalog Dashboard. The dashboard includes features such as keyword-driven 
searching, filtering by various characteristics and topics (e.g. tags, year, geographic level), as well as the ability to 
save and export metadata for desired sources. Note that this catalog is intended to serve as a tool for exploring publicly 
available data resources in the social justice realm, not as a database for housing these resources. The catalog provides 
multiple levels of metadata on each resource and includes links to access the data from its native source.
